# About CashVault

Clearly, CashVault is an application for you to manage your money better and smarter. It's a native application on Scroll.

Personal finance is an important aspect of human lives. Sadly, this is the area many people, particularly the young ones are having problems.

3 questions for self-check:

* do you clearly know how much you made and spent last month?
* have you been consistent enough with your investment?
* how deep do you know about managing your finances?

This is why I am building CashVault...

This is a personal finance application for you to save, budget and invest. This is the application you need to get smarter and become richer onchain.
